TikTok Bot – Launch & Usage Notes
🔹 Development Commands

Start the full app (recommended)
Runs Vite (frontend) + Electron (backend) together.
npm start

Opens the Electron window with your React UI.

Connects to TikTok (main.js runs).

Plays sounds & TTS when events happen.

Run only the frontend (UI only, no TikTok)
Useful if you just want to test the React interface.
npm run dev

Starts Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173

Opens in your browser.

Does not connect to TikTok or play sounds (Electron isn’t running).

Run only Electron
Launches the Electron shell without waiting for Vite.
npm run electron

If Vite isn’t already running → you’ll see a blank Electron screen.

If Vite is running at localhost:5173 → it will load your app UI.

Mainly used for debugging.

🔹 Typical Workflow

Edit code in React (App.jsx) or backend (main.js).

Run: npm start

Wait until the Electron window shows.

Start a TikTok livestream from the username entered in the app UI.

Confirm app status:

🟢 Connected → bot is live.

🔴 Disconnected → not live / username wrong.

Test buttons in the UI to confirm sound & TTS.

🔹 Where things run

Electron / main.js → Connects to TikTok, plays sounds, runs TTS.

Vite / React frontend → Displays UI (status bar, logs, test buttons).

Sounds → Must be in sounds/ folder at project root, e.g.:
project-root/
main.js
preload.js
sounds/
small-gift.mp3
big-gift.mp3
multi-gift.mp3
follow.mp3
share.mp3

Keep sounds 5 seconds or under for best results.

Recommend downloading short sound clips from 👉 https://www.myinstants.com/en/index/us/

🔹 How to Add Your Own Sounds

Go to 👉 https://www.myinstants.com/en/index/us/

Find a sound effect you like (keep it short).

Click Download MP3.

Save it inside your project’s /sounds folder.

Rename it to match one of the events:

small-gift.mp3

big-gift.mp3

multi-gift.mp3

follow.mp3

share.mp3

Restart the app (npm start).

Use the Settings page to double-check or update file paths.

🔹 Current Features

Plays sounds & TTS for TikTok events (likes, gifts, follows, shares, chat).

Test controls for simulating events (accordion opens by default).

Switch between male (David) & female (Zira) voice.

Toggle mute/unmute.

Settings page:

Change sound file paths.

Instructions for where to put sound files.

Notes about keeping files short.

About page updated with developer info + PayPal donation CTA.

🔹 Quick Debug Checklist

If UI loads but no TikTok events → check username input.

If no sounds play → confirm sounds/ folder exists at root.

If no speech → check Windows PowerShell TTS is available.

If Electron shows blank → make sure you started with npm start.

🔹 Git Commands (Project Workflow)

Initial setup
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - TikTok bot"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main

Everyday workflow
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
git push
git pull

Branching workflow
git checkout -b feature/sound-queue
git checkout main
git merge feature/sound-queue
git branch -d feature/sound-queue

Reset / rollback if needed
git reset --hard
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1

Troubleshooting Git
Undo a specific file before commit
git checkout -- filename

Discard all local changes (dangerous)
git reset --hard

Merge conflicts

Git will mark conflict areas in files with >>>>>>> and <<<<<<<

Manually edit files to keep what you want

Then run:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"

Abort a merge if too messy
git merge --abort

Detached HEAD fix
git checkout main
If you want to keep changes:
git checkout -b new-branch

See commit history
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate

Revert a commit safely (creates a new commit)
git revert <commit-id>

Stash work (save without committing)
git stash
git pull
git stash pop

Delete local branch
git branch -d branch-name

Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name

🔹 Packaging into a Windows .exe

Install electron-builder:
npm install --save-dev electron-builder

Add build script to package.json:
"scripts": {
"build": "vite build",
"dist": "electron-builder"
}

Add config:
"build": {
"appId": "com.tiktok.bot",
"productName": "TikTok Bot",
"directories": { "output": "release" },
"files": [
"dist//*",
"main.js",
"preload.js",
"sounds//*",
"package.json"
],
"win": {
"target": "nsis",
"icon": "icon.ico"
}
}

Run: npm run dist

.exe appears in release/.

🔹 Packaging into a Mac .app (DMG)

Update package.json build config:
"build": {
"appId": "com.tiktok.bot",
"productName": "TikTok Bot",
"directories": { "output": "release" },
"files": [
"dist//*",
"main.js",
"preload.js",
"sounds//*",
"package.json"
],
"mac": {
"target": "dmg",
"icon": "icon.icns"
}
}

Run: npm run dist

.dmg appears in release/.
⚠️ Must build on Mac for Mac output (cannot cross-compile from Windows).

🔹 npm Commands (General Reference)

npm install
npm install package-name
npm install --save-dev package-name
npm uninstall package-name
npm update

TikTok Bot Notes

Future Improvements

Prevent overlapping sounds (queue sounds so they play sequentially).

Add option to toggle TikTok username inside UI.

UI indicators for event type (icons, colors).

Cross-platform packaging (Windows & Mac releases).

🔹 Troubleshooting (App Issues)

If npm run dev or npm start fails with “concurrently not recognized” → install it: npm install --save-dev concurrently wait-on

If you see “Failed to resolve import 'react-router-dom'” → install it: npm install react-router-dom

If you see “Failed to resolve import '@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css'” → install it: npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free

If sounds don’t play → confirm the /sounds folder exists and filenames match what the app expects.

If TTS doesn’t work → make sure Windows PowerShell TTS is enabled (System.Speech).

If Electron shows a blank screen → make sure you ran npm start (not just npm run electron).

If the dist folder gets locked and refuses to delete → reboot into Safe Mode and remove it from there.

🔹 Clean Reinstall Checklist

Move out of any locked folder (cd ~ in PowerShell).

If old project is stuck, just ignore it and clone fresh. Example:
cd C:\Users\kjete\OneDrive\Desktop
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
 tiknova_new
cd tiknova_new

Install all dependencies:
npm install
npm install react-router-dom @fortawesome/fontawesome-free concurrently wait-on

Run the app:
npm run dev (UI only) or npm start (full app).

If it works, you can later clean up the old folder in Safe Mode.
